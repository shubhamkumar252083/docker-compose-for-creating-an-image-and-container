in this folder just copy and past the "docker-compose.yml" and "Dockerfile" 

in "docker-compose.yml" file change the ports and change the container_name: django_container to container_name: django_container2 and change command: python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:7000 to command: python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:7001

"docker-compose run --rm app django-admin startproject core ."
and run "docker-compose up" to start the container



for changing the contents of a containe we have to use "sudo"
like - "sudo mkdir templates"


now use "docker-compose up" to run the updated container
